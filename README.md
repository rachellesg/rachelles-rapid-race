# Rachelle's Rapid Race

## Description
GA project for Unit 1

## Gameplay

A simple speed typing game, get as many as you can within 100 seconds, the faster you type the harder the words get!

##### Modes

**Normal**: You start from a list of simple acceptable-length set of words (that start with R, duh) to go through, and as you prove your worth you'll be given lengthier and lengthier words. You'll do fine.

More modes to come.
