# Rachelle's Rapid Race

## Description
GA project for Unit 1

## Gameplay

A simple speed typing game, get as many as you can within 45 seconds, the faster you type the harder the words get. 3 seconds will be added to your timer if you get a word right, but a life will be lost if you get any wrong!

### Modes

**Normal:** You start from a list of simple acceptable-length set of words (that start with R) to go through, and as you prove your worth you'll be given lengthier and lengthier words. You'll do fine.

**Phrases:** In this mode you'll be typing random phrases... or quotes from famous movies!

**CSS:** Practise your CSS typing skills with this new mode!
